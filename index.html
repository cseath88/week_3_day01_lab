                <p>
                    The story of our family's lasagna recipe begins with my grandma, Maria, who immigrated to the United States from Italy in the 1940s. She brought with her a love for cooking and a treasure trove of traditional Italian recipes that she lovingly passed down to her children and grandchildren. One of those cherished recipes was her lasagna, a labor of love that she would spend hours preparing in her cozy kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember watching her in awe as she sautéed onions and garlic, browned ground beef and Italian sausage, and simmered a rich tomato sauce with fragrant herbs. The aroma that wafted from her kitchen was simply irresistible, and my siblings and I would eagerly wait for the moment when Grandma would assemble the lasagna layers and pop it into the oven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the lasagna baked, the anticipation grew, and we could hardly wait to dig into the piping hot, cheesy layers of pasta and sauce. When it finally emerged from the oven, golden and bubbling, we would gather around the table, eager to indulge in this comforting and delicious masterpiece. It was a moment of pure joy as we savored each bite, the flavors melding together in perfect harmony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, the tradition of making Grandma's lasagna has been passed down in our family, and it has become a staple at our own Sunday family dinners. The recipe has remained unchanged, a testament to its timeless appeal and the love that goes into making it. Now, I'm excited to share this cherished recipe with you, so you can experience the joy of making and enjoying a classic lasagna with your own loved ones.

                    Ingredients:
                    For the meat sauce:
                    1 tablespoon olive oil
                    1 onion, finely chopped
                    3 cloves garlic, minced
                    1 pound ground beef
                    1 pound Italian sausage
                    1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
                    1 can (14 ounces) tomato sauce
                    2 tablespoons tomato paste
                    1 teaspoon dried basil
                    1 teaspoon dried oregano
                    1/2 teaspoon salt
                    1/4 teaspoon black pepper
                    For the ricotta cheese mixture:
                    2 cups ricotta cheese
                    1 egg
                    1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
                    1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
                    2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
                    For assembling:
                    12 lasagna noodles, cooked according to package instructions
                    2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
                    1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instructions:
                    Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
                    In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
                    Add the ground beef and Italian sausage to the skillet, and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.
                    Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
                </p>
